# AdminLTE-chatroom
AdminLTE & socket.io frontend template

I've edited the AdminLTE Dashboard and used some menu only in the Dashboard. I aslo make static pages for navbar, sidebar and footer.

I also learn socket.io and implemented it in the Dashboard. You can try the Chatroom but need two browsers or more to see it clearly how it worked.

Steps to use the project:

1. Clone or download the project into your local.
2. Run cmd and change the repository to the folder.
3. Run 'npm start'
4. It will show 'listening to requests on port 4000'
5. Open your browser and go to localhost:4000

Go to Issues for example of pictures.


-----------UPDATE------------

I've live this project in my server. Check it out:
